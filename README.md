## What is Earn2Post

Earn2Post is a socialmedia platform where users posting and commenting is limited by so called social credit that users can earn from a activity on the platfrom.

## Project Status

After 11 sprints we have somewhat completed our socialmedia project and it is now available for everyone. We did not manage to finish the whole thing with given time, but the end product is still pretty nice.
